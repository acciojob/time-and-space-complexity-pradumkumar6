	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time 
        an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of its input. An algorithm with 
        better Time complexity is generally considered more efficient.
	</p>
	  <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the total memory space required by an algorithm during 
        execution. It includes the memory for input values, variables, and auxiliary structures. 
        For example, an algorithm that requires additional storage proportional to its input size 
        may have a Space Complexity of O(n).
